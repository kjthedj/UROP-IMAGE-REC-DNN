# UROP-IMAGE-REC-DNN

FraunhofferandFresnalDiffraction.ipynb showcases initial explorations done into the concept of Fresnel and Fraunhofer diffraction with various apertures.

image discretization.ipynb showcases initial ground-up work done to understand how an image is discretized into a matrix for image processing tasks.

manifestingsucess.ipynb is the final script used to model the DNN introduced in the paper "ll-optical machine learning using diffractive deep neural networks" at this link:-https://www.science.org/doi/full/10.1126/science.aat8084
